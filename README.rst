pychebfun - Python Chebyshev Functions
======================================

ABOUT
-----

The Chebfun system is designed to perform fast and accurate functional 
computations. The system incorporates the use of Chebyshev polynomial 
expansions, Lagrange interpolation with the barycentric formula, and 
Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature to perform fast functional evaluation, integration,
root-finding, and other operations.

The pychebfun project is based on the mathematical work of Battles and 
Trefethen et. al. yet is optimized to take advantage of the tools in the 
Numpy/Scipy and Sage libraries. This project is solely for the educational 
purposes of the owner and is not meant to compete with the Matlab library 
created by Battles and Trefethen. Any questions regarding the Chebfun package 
for Matlab should be directed towards the Chebfun team:

Pychebfun was started by Chris Swierczewski <cswiercz@amath.washington.edu> 
from the Applied Mathematics department at the University of Washington in
